## UKs Used Cars, from Multivariant Data Analysis to Predictive Modeling 


This comprehensive report encapsulates a rigorous analytical journey through a vast dataset of UK used car
data. Beginning with meticulous data validation, including a thorough Univariate Descriptive Analysis for
each variable, the narrative unfolds to detail strategic data imputation for both numerical and categorical
variables. The exploration deepens with a discerning Feature Selection process, sharpening the focus for
both numeric and binary targets. Advanced multivariate techniques, such as Principal Component and Multiple Correspondence Analysis, further refine the dataset, culminating in a robust clustering for population
segmentation. The crux of the report is the meticulous Model Building process, adeptly balancing statistical rigor with practical insights for numeric and binary responses, reinforced by stringent model validation
techniques.

This report presents an exploratory analysis of the 100,000 UK used car dataset. The dataset includes
information from four major car manufacturers: Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen. The data consists
of details such as car model, registration year, price, gearbox type, mileage, engine fuel, tax, consumption
in miles per gallon, and engine size.
To make the analysis manageable and sample of 5,000 records has been selected from
this extensive dataset.
